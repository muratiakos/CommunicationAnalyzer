# Analysis of corporate communication
`Analysis of corporate communication` is my thesis work
which - in addition to strategic and analytical overviews
about Business Intelligence solutions - designs and
implements a dedicated BI
system for analyzing various communication channels in a
corporate environment.

The system uses `Oracle DB` and `Oracle BI` with a custom
designed star-scheme for `OLAP` to support the `.NET WCF`
backend services to provide context analysis.
An example communication channel integration was implemented
via a `JavaMail` collector to process andfeed e-mail messages.
I also developed a full `.NET` desktop app with powerful
graph visualizations and context-relation analysis capabilities.

The document and source-code of my thesis was published in 2010
at BME Department of Telecommunications and Media Informatics.
