# Analysis of corporate communication
`Analysis of corporate communication` is my thesis work
which - in addition to strategic and alaytical overview -
designs and implements a dedicated Business Intelligence
system for analyzing corporate communication channels.

The system uses `Oracle DB` and `Oracle BI` with a custom
designed star-schema for OLAP to support the .NET backend
services with context analysis. An example communication
channel integration is implemented via a `JavaMail`
collector to process and feed e-mail messages. I also
developed a full `.NET` client with powerful graph and
relation analysis visualizations.

The document and source-code of my thesis published in 2010 at
BME Department of Telecommunications and Media Informatics.

Special thanks to my university consultant, Zsolt Kardkov√°cs.
