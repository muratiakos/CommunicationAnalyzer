# Analysis of corporate communication
This folder contains my written thesis and its document resources in various formats.

## Abstract
In the introduction of my thesis I present the concept and
significance of Business Intelligence and those corporate
demands which have led to the evolution of BI, and I also
enumerate some BI solutions, which are being applied in our
days. At the end of this chapter I declare that there is no
available BI solution which could support corporate
communication analysis in its entirety.

The strategic and analysis section of my paper demonstrates the
general corporate communication environment and its possibilities
from the aspect of analysis, and I set up the concepts and
principles of the communication analysis based on those. I define
some analytical method and visualization possibilities and I also
design the semantic model of the communication analysis.

Henceforward I briefly summarize the typical corporate communication
channels and then I specify the details and possibilities of e-mail
analysis and those information which can be extracted from it. I
describe the required tasks and problems of the e-mail processing,
then I introduce and evaluate an e-mail analyzer application called
`Deep Email Miner`.

In the chapter of System Design, I specify the system architecture,
the components and functions to be implemented and I also describe
the decisions I made during the planning period. Based on the
previously defined semantic model, I created the logical data model
of the system and I also designed the star-schema of my systemâ€™s
database considering the design principles of analytical-databases.

Section 6 describes the development and implementation of my system,
including the implemented functions, developed modules and those
tools, environments and component libraries which have been used
for the implementation.

The final part of my thesis evaluates and summarizes the engineering
and development results of my `Communication Analyzer System`. During
the evaluation I specify the details of message collection, analysis
and visualization components, illustrating with measurements and
screenshots as the visualization components being important parts of
the system.

My intention is that the `Communication Analyzer System` - with further
improvements and more communication channel collection modules beyond
e-mail - be a useful, efficient and complete solution for corporate
communication analysis.
